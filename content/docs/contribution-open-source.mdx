- **🔍 Transparency** - Full visibility into how components work
- **🤝 Community** - Built by developers, for developers
- **🔒 Security** - Open code means better security through peer review
- **📈 Innovation** - Faster iteration through community contributions
- **💰 Cost-Effective** - Free to use, modify, and distribute
